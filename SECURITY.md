# Digital Voting System - Security Documentation

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Digital Voting System to ensure election integrity, voter privacy, and system protection.

## üîê Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security Model

The system implements a comprehensive security architecture with multiple layers of protection:

1. **Authentication Layer**: User verification and access control
2. **Data Layer**: Encrypted storage and integrity validation
3. **Session Layer**: Secure session management and monitoring
4. **Network Layer**: Input validation and sanitization
5. **Audit Layer**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## üõ°Ô∏è Authentication Security

### Admin Authentication

**Strong Password Requirements**
- Default admin credentials: `admin/admin123`
- Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 algorithm
- No plain text password storage
- Immediate password verification without storing attempts

**Account Lockout Protection**
- Maximum 3 failed login attempts
- Automatic 15-minute lockout after excessive attempts
- Progressive lockout duration for repeated violations
- Admin notification of lockout events

**Session Security**
- Unique session tokens for each login
- Automatic session invalidation on logout
- Session timeout after inactivity
- Multi-session detection and management

### Voter Authentication

**Aadhaar ID Validation**
- Strict 8-digit numeric format enforcement
- Pattern detection for invalid sequences (e.g., 11111111, 12345678)
- Registration database verification
- Real-time duplicate vote prevention

**Voter Registration Security**
- Pre-registered voter database (20 unique IDs)
- No on-the-fly registration to prevent voter manipulation
- Cryptographic hashing of voter identities
- Anonymous vote linking prevention

## üîí Data Protection

### Vote Anonymity

**Anonymous Vote Recording**
- Voter IDs are hashed before storage
- No direct link between voter identity and vote choice
- Vote records contain only timestamp, voter hash, and candidate ID
- Impossible to trace votes back to specific voters

**Data Separation**
```
voters.txt     ‚Üí Registered voter IDs
votes.txt      ‚Üí Anonymous vote records (hash:candidate:timestamp)
candidates.txt ‚Üí Candidate information
activity.log   ‚Üí Audit trail (no vote details)
```

### File System Security

**Secure File Storage**
- All data files stored in protected `data/` directory
- File integrity validation on startup
- Automatic data directory creation with proper permissions
- Atomic file operations to prevent corruption

**Data Encryption**
- Sensitive data encrypted using XOR cipher with system key
- Voter identity hashing for anonymity protection
- Secure random token generation for sessions
- Base64 encoding for data transmission

### Data Integrity

**Integrity Validation**
- File existence and readability checks
- Data format validation on load
- Consistency checks between related data files
- Automatic recovery mechanisms for corrupted data

**Tamper Detection**
- Activity logging for all data modifications
- Timestamp validation for vote records
- Session state validation
- Suspicious activity pattern detection

## üö® Security Monitoring

### Real-Time Monitoring

**Activity Logging**
All system activities are logged with:
- Timestamp (ISO format)
- Action type (LOGIN, VOTE_CAST, SESSION_START, etc.)
- User identifier (admin username or voter hash)
- Detailed description of action
- Security event classification

**Example Log Entry:**
```
2025-01-15T14:30:25:VOTE_CAST:VOTER_123456:Vote cast for candidate: CAND_001
2025-01-15T14:31:02:ADMIN_AUTH_SUCCESS:admin:Admin authentication successful
2025-01-15T14:31:15:SESSION_STOP:admin:Voting session stopped
```

### Suspicious Activity Detection

**Automated Threat Detection**
- Multiple failed login attempts from same source
- Sequential voting patterns indicating automation
- Unusual session duration or frequency
- Data file modification outside normal operations
- Invalid input pattern recognition

**Security Alerts**
- Real-time console notifications for security events
- Automatic account lockout for suspicious behavior
- Emergency lockdown capability for critical threats
- Comprehensive security reporting

## üîç Input Validation & Sanitization

### Input Security

**Comprehensive Validation**
- Aadhaar ID: Exactly 8 digits, no patterns, registered verification
- Candidate ID: Alphanumeric, 1-10 characters, unique validation
- Names: Alphabetic with spaces, 2-50 characters
- Party Names: Alphanumeric with spaces, 2-30 characters

**Input Sanitization**
```java
// Example sanitization process
String sanitized = input.replaceAll("[<>"'&;]", "");  // Remove dangerous chars
sanitized = sanitized.trim();                          // Remove whitespace
if (sanitized.length() > 100) {                      // Limit length
    sanitized = sanitized.substring(0, 100);
}
```

**Injection Prevention**
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized operations
- XSS prevention through input encoding
- Command injection prevention through input validation
- Path traversal prevention through path sanitization

## üîê Session Management

### Secure Sessions

**Session Creation**
- Unique session identifier generation using SecureRandom
- Session state tracking with timeout management
- Multiple session detection and handling
- Automatic session cleanup on application exit

**Session Security**
- No session data stored in cookies or temporary files
- Memory-only session storage
- Automatic session invalidation on security events
- Session hijacking prevention through token validation

### Access Control

**Role-Based Security**
- Admin-only functions: Session management, candidate addition
- Voter-only functions: Vote casting, candidate viewing
- System functions: Audit logging, integrity checking
- Strict role enforcement at method level

## üõ°Ô∏è Vote Integrity Protection

### Anti-Tampering Measures

**Vote Validation**
- Duplicate vote prevention per voter per session
- Candidate existence validation before vote recording
- Session status verification before accepting votes
- Atomic vote recording operations

**Vote Security Flow**

3. Previous vote check ‚Üí Duplicate prevention
4. Candidate validation ‚Üí Valid candidate verification
5. Vote recording ‚Üí Atomic write operation
6. Confirmation ‚Üí Success notification
7. Audit logging ‚Üí Security trail creation
```
